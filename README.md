## Title of the Project
Harnessing Deep Learning for Fabric Defect Detection
Fabric defect detection have importance in terms of sectoral quality. Automatic systems are developed on the defect detection, in this regard many methods are tried to obtain high precision with image processing studies

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
Fabric defect detection plays an increasingly important role in the industrial automation application for fabric production, but how to detect defects rapidly and accurately is still challenging. In this study, we propose a powerful fabric defect detection method using a hybrid of convolutional neural network (CNN) and variational autoencoder (VAE). The convolutional layers are used for extracting fabric image pattern features and the variational autoencoder is used for modeling the latent characteristics and inferring a reconstruction. The defect positions can be detected by the differences between the original image and the reconstruction image. The proposed method is validated on public patterned fabric datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve outstanding performance in both image level and pixel level defect detection
